# Progress

## What Works

1. **Core Infrastructure**

   - TypeScript configuration with strict mode
   - Build system with source maps
   - Testing framework with Jest
   - Linting and formatting with ESLint + Prettier

2. **Core Features**

   - Meta class with comprehensive metadata management
   - LibraryConfig for library-level settings
   - FolderConfig for folder-specific configurations
   - AppConfig for application-wide settings
   - File system operations with JSON persistence
   - Path resolution utilities
   - Type-safe configuration interfaces

3. **Development Tools**
   - Git hooks with Husky
   - Commit message validation
   - Automated releases
   - Type checking
   - Documentation generation

## What's Left to Build

1. **Features**

   - Additional metadata format support
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Configuration validation
   - Advanced error handling
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Testing**

   - Complete test coverage for file operations
   - Integration tests for configuration management
   - End-to-end tests for metadata workflows
   - Performance tests for large datasets

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation with examples
   - Usage patterns and best practices
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Migration guides
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Current Status

1. **Development**

   - Meta class implementation complete
   - Core configuration features working
   - File system operations implemented
   - Type safety enforced
   - Initial tests passing

2. **Quality**
   - Type safety with strict mode
   - Basic tests in place
   - Code style enforced
   - Build process working
   - Documentation in progress

## Known Issues

1. **Technical**

   - Test coverage needs improvement
   - Documentation needs expansion
