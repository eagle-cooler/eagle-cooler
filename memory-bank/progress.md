# Progress

## What Works

1. **Core Infrastructure**

   - TypeScript configuration with strict mode
   - Build system with source maps
   - Testing framework with Jest
   - Linting and formatting with ESLint + Prettier

2. **Core Features**

   - Meta class for metadata management
   - WebAPI class for Eagle API integration
   - EagleWrapover for Eagle logic abstraction
   - File system utilities and type definitions
   - API token management
   - HTTP request handling
   - JSON file operations

3. **Development Tools**
   - Git hooks with Husky
   - Commit message validation
   - Automated releases
   - Type checking
   - Documentation generation

## What's Left to Build

1. **Features**

   - Complete EagleWrapover implementation
   - Additional API integrations
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Advanced error handling
   - Performance optimizations

2. **Testing**

   - Complete test coverage for API operations
   - Integration tests for Eagle wrapper
   - End-to-end tests for API workflows
   - Performance tests for large datasets

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation with examples
   - Usage patterns and best practices
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Migration guides
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Current Status

1. **Development**

   - Core classes implemented
   - API integration working
   - File system operations implemented
   - Type safety enforced
   - Initial tests passing

2. **Quality**
   - Type safety with strict mode
   - Basic tests in place
   - Code style enforced
   - Build process working
   - Documentation in progress

## Known Issues

1. **Technical**

   - Test coverage needs improvement
   - Documentation needs expansion
   - Error handling needs enhancement
   - Wrapper implementation incomplete
   - Performance optimization required

2. **Process**
   - CI/CD pipeline refinement
   - Release process optimization
   - Documentation updates
   - Test coverage improvement

## Evolution of Decisions

1. **Architecture**

   - Implemented class-based design
   - Added type safety with strict mode
   - Enhanced API integration
   - Improved file system operations
   - Added Eagle wrapper abstraction

2. **Development**
   - Adopted conventional commits
   - Implemented semantic versioning
   - Added automated releases
   - Enhanced code quality tools
   - Improved documentation practices
